ComfyViewer is a tool designed for artists, developers, and enthusiasts who work with AI image generation tools. It allows you to load an entire folder of images directly into your browser, where you can browse, search, and inspect the rich metadata embedded within them. Your files are never uploaded to a server; all processing and storage happens locally on your machine using your browser's own database.
